# AwesomeWM-Config

This is my personal AwesomeWM Config for anyine who wants to take a look at it and make their own.

# Dependencies:
Nitrogen
Compton (or picom)
Emacs
Vivaldi

If you would like to use this config on an Arch-based system, in the "Autostart" section of rc.lua, launch picom instead of compton.

Thank You!
