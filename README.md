# AwesomeWM-Config

This is my personal AwesomeWM Config for anyine who wants to take a look at it and make their own.

# Dependencies:
- Nitrogen
- Compton (or picom)
- Emacs
- Vivaldi

If your system uses picom instead of compton (or if you want to use a different compsitor), in the "Autostart" section of rc.lua, launch picom instead of compton.
